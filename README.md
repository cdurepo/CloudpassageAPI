# CloudpassageAPI

 ** CloudpassageAPI test to user the SDK to gather information and make a report **

 ## Summary
 Using the python SDK we are going to make a report as outlined in the APIExercise request.  
 We will return info on some of the top issues and accounts.

 ## Design
 For now it is a single python file to connect and gather all the info and make the report.
 Each step has been made it own function for better code reuse.
